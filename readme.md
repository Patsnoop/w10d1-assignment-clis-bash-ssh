This assignment was somewhat easy compared to others we have had recently.

Creating the bash.sh file was mostly just copying from the Assignment document and getting the code to run, which took a few minutes. 
I had to open a new terminal that was running in bash instead of powershell to get the file to work run properly.

The automated task was a bit more complex, but once I figured out the syntax, it was another simple, yet powerful tool to add to my skillset.
I decided to make a backup system for my files because I should start using an external harddrive to backup my important files. I already use a cloud service, but you can never be too careful

I look forward to using these types of programs in the future to assist with not only my class work, but to further my career.
